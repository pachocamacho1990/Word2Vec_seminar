**HOW CAN WE TEACH A MACHINE TO UNDERSTAND AND ANALYZE HOW PEOPLE COMMUNICATE?**

Introducing embeddings with Word2Vec Family !

**Abstract of the talk:** 

In the  growing  and  fast-changing  field  of  machine  learning,  one  of  the  most  important  areas  of research and application is Natural  Language Processing (NLP).  This concerns the application of computational techniques to analyze and synthetize large volumesof written and spoken language data. Sincecomputers  are  designed  to  work  with  numerical  and  well-structured data,  the  main problem with NLP is finding ways to  transform natural language data (which is non-numerical and unstructured) into structured numerical data that is suitable for machine learning algorithms. In this sense,  the  term  word  embedding  refers  to  a  class  of  techniques  that  are  specifically  designed  to perform this kind of data transformation. 

In  this  talk  we will introduce  the  concept of  word  embedding  and  discuss  the  different  techniques that  exists  nowadays  to  build  different  kinds  of  word  embeddings. The  purpose  of  the  talk  is  two folded (theoretical and practical). First, we will discuss the theoretical basis of the most prominent and  widely used word embeddings  followed  by  a  presentation  of  some  mathematical “still-open” challenges around these techniques. Then, we will have a hands-on session using some of the main libraries implemented in the python language to build a simple clustering algorithm of conversations in social networks.
